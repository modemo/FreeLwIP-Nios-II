add_sw_setting boolean system_h_define system.use_16_bit_ticks OS_USE_16_BIT_TICKS 0 "Time is measured in 'ticks' - which is the number of times the tick interrupt has executed since the kernel was started. The tick count is held in a variable of type portTickType. Defining configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS as 1 causes portTickType to be defined (typedef'ed) as an unsigned 16bit type. Defining configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS as 0 causes portTickType to be defined (typedef'ed) as an unsigned 32bit type.

Using a 16 bit type will greatly improve performance on 8 and 16 bit architectures, but limits the maximum specifiable time period to 65535 'ticks'. Therefore, assuming a tick frequency of 250Hz, the maximum time a task can delay or block when a 16bit counter is used is 262 seconds, compared to 17179869 seconds when using a 32bit counter."

add_sw_setting decimal_number system_h_define system.tick_rate_hz OS_TICK_RATE_HZ 1000 " -- ignored ... calculated on the go -- The frequency of the RTOS tick interrupt.
The tick interrupt is used to measure time. Therefore a higher tick frequency means time can be measured to a higher resolution. However, a high tick frequency also means that the kernel will use more CPU time so be less efficient. The RTOS demo applications all use a tick rate of 1000Hz. This is used to test the kernel and is higher than would normally be required.

More than one task can share the same priority. The kernel will share processor time between tasks of the same priority by switching between the tasks during each RTOS tick. A high tick rate frequency will therefore also have the effect of reducing the 'time slice' given to each task."

add_sw_setting boolean system_h_define system.idle_should_yield OS_IDLE_SHOULD_YIELD 0 "This parameter controls the behaviour of tasks at the idle priority. It only has an effect if:
The preemptive scheduler is being used.
The users application creates tasks that run at the idle priority.
Tasks that share the same priority will time slice. Assuming none of the tasks get preempted, it might be assumed that each task of at a given priority will be allocated an equal amount of processing time - and if the shared priority is above the idle priority then this is indeed the case.
 When tasks share the idle priority the behaviour can be slightly different. When configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD is set to 1 the idle task will yield immediately should any other task at the idle priority be ready to run. This ensures the minimum amount of time is spent in the idle task when application tasks are available for scheduling. This behaviour can however have undesirable effects (depending on the needs of your application) as depicted below:


This diagram shows the execution pattern of four tasks at the idle priority. Tasks A, B and C are application tasks. Task I is the idle task. A context switch occurs with regular period at times T0, T1, ..., T6. When the idle task yields task A starts to execute - but the idle task has already taken up some of the current time slice. This results in task I and task A effectively sharing a time slice. The application tasks B and C therefore get more processing time than the application task A.

This situation can be avoided by:

If appropriate, using an idle hook in place of separate tasks at the idle priority.
Creating all application tasks at a priority greater than the idle priority.
Setting configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD to 0.
Setting configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD prevents the idle task from yielding processing time until the end of its time slice. This ensure all tasks at the idle priority are allocated an equal amount of processing time - but at the cost of a greater proportion of the total processing time being allocated to the idle task."

add_sw_setting decimal_number system_h_define memory.check_for_stack_overflow OS_CHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW 2 "Stack Overflow Detection - Method 1
 It is likely that the stack will reach its greatest (deepest) value after the kernel has swapped the task out of the Running state because this is when the stack will contain the task context. At this point the kernel can check that the processor stack pointer remains within the valid stack space. The stack overflow hook function is called if the stack pointer contain a value that is outside of the valid stack range.
This method is quick but not guaranteed to catch all stack overflows. Set configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW to 1 to use this method only.


Stack Overflow Detection - Method 2

 When a task is first created its stack is filled with a known value. When swapping a task out of the Running state the kernel can check the last 16 bytes within the valid stack range to ensure that these known values have not been overwritten by the task or interrupt activity. The stack overflow hook function is called should any of these 16 bytes not remain at their initial value.
This method is less efficient than method one, but still fairly fast. It is very likely to catch stack overflows but is still not guaranteed to catch all overflows.

To use this method in combination with method 1 set configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW to 2. It is not possible to use only this method.

It contains the information required by a debugger to locate each registered queue and semaphore.

configQUEUE_REGISTRY_SIZE defines the maximum number of queues and semaphores that can be registered.

The fully featured API has more complex code that takes longer to execute, but makes much less use of critical sections.
